# General Description
  Our project is a modified version of Battleship. It follows all the rules to regular Battleship with some additions. These additions are: each ship has stats and special abilities, ship movement, a bigger playing field, and modifications to the playing field throughout the game. Each player will control their fleet in order to sink the opponents's ships.
  
  Each player will receive a 15x15 grid to place their vessels. The vessels are Aircraft Carrier, Battleship, Destroyer, Submarine, and Cruiser. They will only recieve one of each type of vessel. This will be all done in the PlayerGrid class and the abstract class Ship and the subclasses of Ship.
  
  Once the everything is set up and both players are ready to play, each player will be prompted to either shoot a number of shots based on the number of their remaining ship or use their ability of a ship. Each player will be able to "markup" a grid to place shot locations (hit or miss). Players are allowed to move their ship for a distance based on their The game is over once all ships on one playerâ€™s grid have all sunk.
